In a video clip that has gone viral on social media, Kohli jumped the queue and didn\u2019t shake with Ganguly, with whom he doesn\u2019t believe to share a great history. Moreover, Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting was also seen having a word with Kohli after he avoided shaking hands with DC\u2019s director of cricket.\n\nWatch the video here -\n\nVirat kohli Ignore Ganguly not even handshake .its call karma ganguly never mess with king kohli\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d pic.twitter.com/IeHjmvI32S \u2014 Radhe krishna\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 (@king_Virat140) April 15, 2023 \u00d7\n\nVirat starred in RCB\u2019s 23-run win over Delhi Capitals, hitting his third fifty of the season in the game. Even during the match, both seemed to share cold vibes and didn\u2019t see each other eye to eye.\n\nRecently, Chetan Sharma, BCCI\u2019s former chief selector, on a string operation done on him, revealed that ex-BCCI President Ganguly did play a little role in deciding Virat Kohli\u2019s fate as the Indian captain across formats during his tenure. Besides, he also admitted that Ganguly alongside him didn\u2019t like Kohli.\n\nNot only this, but Chetan also revealed that Kohli was informed beforehand about his removal as the captain, and that the former number one batter lied to the media when asked about the same upon him landing in South Africa for the bilateral series in 2021/2022.\n\nAfter the news broke out, there was a strange wave in Indian cricket that saw things getting ugly at all levels. With the team then scheduled to play bilateral series against Australia, everything went under the mat.\n\nHowever, after what transpired at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, the venue where Virat created history, it doesn\u2019t look like all is well between two giant figures of Indian cricket.",

        "Article": "The Gujarat Titans secured a close win against Punjab Kings on Thursday night, securing their third win of the 2023 Indian Premier League season. Chasing a 154-run target, the Titans did face some hiccups towards the closing stages of the game but Rahul Tewatia secured a win for the side, hitting a four when Titans needed as many to win from the last two deliveries. Their opener Shubman Gill was the star for GT with the bat, as he scored an important 67 off 49 deliveries, smashing seven fours and a six. Virat Kohli; Ramiz Raja; Shubman Gill(PTI/YouTube)\n\nGill held one end as wickets continued to fall on the other, and maintained the pace of run-scoring as Sai Sudharsan (19 off 20 balls), Hardik Pandya (8 off 11 balls), and David Miller (17* off 18 balls) all struggled to hit big throughout their innings.\n\nAlso read: 'There are faults in system': Kaif blasts Laxman-led NCA over no clarity on Bumrah injury\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja was mightily impressed with Gill's battting in the game against Punjab Kings, and expressed his agreement with the popular opinion that Gill could succeed Virat Kohli's as India's next top-batter across all formats.\n\n\u201cHe has so much potential, he has so much time. He looks so naturally beautiful when he plays. When he drives, there's a curve on the shot. He has a lot of time to play his strokes. It doesn't matter if he scores on the off side, on side, hook or pull, it's just so beautiful and neat-and-clean. Many predict that he could be the next best batsman after Virat Kohli. He has touch, class, and elegance like Rohit Sharma. And his temperament is quite strong,\u201d Raja said on his official YouTube channel.\n\n\u201cFrom Tests, ODIs, and T20Is as well, he has tormented the bowlers.

        "Article": "Mumbai can't dwell on that, Rohit insisted. \"For the past six to eight months, I am used to playing without Jasprit Bumrah [for India too],\" he said after the loss. \"Of course, this is a different set-up. Someone needs to put their hand up and come in to fill that place. We can't keep dwelling on it. You can try and control the things that are in your control and those that are not in your control, you can't do that. Injuries are not in your control.\n\n\"The other guys that we have are talented. It's just that they haven't played a lot of IPL. We need to give them the support.\"\n\nDefending 171, each of Mumbai's bowlers - save for experienced legspinner Piyush Chawla whose four overs went for only 26 - had an economy rate in excess of eight. Their 11.2 overs of fast bowling - which included the likes of Jofra Archer, Cameron Green and Jason Behrendorff - went at a rate of 11.29 runs per over and that more than nullified the control Chawla had. It meant Mumbai lost their opening match by eight wickets with a whopping 22 balls remaining.\n\nOn the night, it was not just their bowling that let five-time champions Mumbai down. They had crumbled to 48 for 4 in the ninth over after being asked to bat and could get past 170 only because of rookie Tilak Varma 's partnerships with Nehal Wadhera and Arshad Khan - both of whom were on T20 debuts. Varma added 50 with Wadhera for the fifth wicket before combining with Arshad to add an unbroken 48 in 17 balls, and in the process he stayed unbeaten on 84 off 46 balls. Rohit heaped praise on the youngster for \"showing courage and being brave\" in the middle.\n\n\"He is a very positive person, quite talented as well,\" Rohit said. \"Some of the shots he played, in the first game of the season, he showed a lot of courage. That is something we spoke of - we want to be brave and courageous in the middle. We didn't start well, and it was always a catching up game. Hats off to Tilak to get us to a competitive total.\n\n\"It was a good pitch to bat on. We didn't bat to even half of our potential and yet got to 170. Probably 30-40 runs more would have been ideal. We were struggling to play the catch-up game but Tilak was magnificent.\"\n\nKohli: 'Me and Faf got off to the perfect start' Mumbai had the momentum after a strong finish with the bat and would have been hopeful of ending their streak of starting an IPL season with a loss, one that has been going on since 2013. But Mumbai had the momentum after a strong finish with the bat and would have been hopeful of ending their streak of starting an IPL season with a loss, one that has been going on since 2013. But Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis added 148 for the opening wicket to quash any hope Mumbai had of disappointing a sold-out Chinnaswamy Stadium. Later, Kohli said that the \"phenomenal win\" capped off a near-perfect homecoming for them.\n\n\"I thought with the new ball it [the pitch] was a bit tricky [to bat on],\" Kohli said. \"But because we took them [their bowlers] down with the new ball, that's where we shifted the momentum completely towards us. How they batted in the last two overs, it could have been tricky to walk out without intent. The way we both started nullified the intensity that they were going to bring onto the field.\n\nFaf du Plessis and Virat Kohli started strongly for Royal Challengers Bangalore \u2022 BCCI\n\n\"Me and Faf got off to the perfect start. We kept going, kept backing ourselves. Faf went first and then I joined later. So, it was a very comprehensive win and we wanted to win with balls to spare so that it could benefit our net run rate a little bit.\"\n\nDespite being part of the Royal Challengers squad, legspinner Karn Sharma did not get a game last season. On Sunday, though, he picked up a couple of crucial middle-order wickets to puncture Mumbai's recovery. After being hit for two sixes by Wadhera, Karn tossed another one up to have him hole out before getting one past hard-hitter Tim David to bowl him.\n\n\"When he got the left-hander out after getting hit for two sixes, that's brave bowling,\" Kohli said of Karn. \"That comes from a lot of repetition of bowling in the right spot. He's had a good domestic season. He was bowling so well for us last year, unfortunately he couldn't get a game. He was ready to play, even in the nets here he wasn't getting hit for sixes in the nets easily.",

The left-handed Rinku pulled off a magical heist as he hammered five successive sixes off Gujarat Titans ' Yash Dayal from the last five balls of KKR's run chase to hand his side a miraculous three-wicket win.Not even the world's best batters would have backed themselves to hit five consecutive sixes with their team requiring 28 from the last five balls. Rinku garnered praise from all quarters and he found a new admirer in none other than Virat Kohli , who said he could not even think of doing that stuff in such a situation.\"What the youngsters are doing today is amazing to see. Look at this IPL, I couldn't even think of doing stuff what these young guys are doing. Just the other night, Rinku Singh hits 5 Sixes in last 5 balls which is amazing & never happened something like that. Coming in an hitting five sixes in a row to win a match, I mean what level is this? So that transition is happening is great. It is great to see such youngsters coming up,\" Kohli told Indian cricketer Robin Uthappa on Jio Cinema.Kohli also talked about the strike rate in T20 cricket saying that the 'anchor role' in T20s is still important. Former Kiwi cricketer and commentator Simon Doull's recently criticised Kohli for his strike rate against Lucknow Super Giants in Bangalore.\"Yeah for sure (important anchor role). I completely agree with that, There are many people who because they have not been in that situation themselves, they look at the game differently. Suddenly when the power play is done, they will be like 'oh, they have started rotating the strike,\" Kohli said.\"I'm not thinking about strike rate. Oh my strike rate must be 160 plus or anything. I play T20 cricket for according to the situation. If situation demands I can play 230 strike rate and I can do this any day. I always play for my team & not for myself,\" he added.",
